                    created to apply my newly acquired HTML knowledge.

This project served as a comprehensive exercise in applying CSS principles after completing the theory. Originally intended to be a single responsive web page listing recipes, I elevated it into a fully-fledged website, complete with a custom-designed logo and meticulously crafted content for each page.

The primary objective was to create a fully responsive multi-paged college website with a clean and organized codebase, maintaining a consistent styling theme for a professional aesthetic. Although predominantly HTML and CSS, the project introduced some elements of JavaScript and PHP.

                    Derived from a YouTube tutorial, the Personal Portfolio Website project was a significant step in mastering responsive design while refining HTML and CSS skills. The primary goal was to create a fully responsive single-paged portfolio website with a focus on mobile-first design principles. The inclusion of JavaScript, though minimal, added interactive elements to enhance user experience.<br><br>
                    In an effort to elevate the portfolio, the website evolved from a single-paged structure to a portal showcasing all Code Canvas Web Development projects. Two additional pages, the Listings page and the Portfolio Portal Page, were integrated to provide a comprehensive overview. The project served as a platform to challenge and further develop skills, resulting in a website that aligns with the creator's satisfaction.
